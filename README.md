## Description
This application can be used to generate an office roster with three positions, manager, engineer and intern. All positions have a field for the employee's name, email, ID and role. Where they differ is that for manager, an office number is given, for the engineer their GitHub and the intern's school.

## Usage
Before using the application, make sure node and inquirer are installed. If so, clone the repository and then in the terminal run the command "node index." This will initiate inquirer, which will prompt questions on the employees and use the values to generate an HTML file with FS.
