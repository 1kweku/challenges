## Description 
This application can construct an HTML file of an office roster and fill the position of manager, engineer and intern. All positions have a name, role, ID and email. The difference between the 3 is that managers have their office numbers, engineer's have their GitHub and interns have their school. Information is prompted using inquirer and passed in the index.html using FS.

## Usage
First and foremost, to use this applicaiton make sure to have to have node as well as the inquirer. Clone the repo to your device, and in the integrated terminal, use "node index" as the commands to initiate it. Inquirer will then prompt a series of questions, which will be used to construct the HTML file. If there is an error, a message will appear in the terminal informing you of it, otherwise "HTML generated!" will be displayed
